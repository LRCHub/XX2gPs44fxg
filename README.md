```
Gracefully sneaking up on me
They just want to tear my feathers
The golden light of the setting sun
Let me be a hypocrite again
I will be gone before long
I know I'm wrong
No matter how far I go, they find me out
I wish the gusts took away my gloom
I can't help this vague feeling
I feel so good, but I'm worn out
We'll be all right, don't look so sad
Confess my sin, conceal them all
Night will come soon and swallow everything
Quietly hiding in the grass
Hearing the leaves rustling
They're singing with a burning piano
It gives me cheap relief
I will be gone before long
I know I'm wrong
No matter how far I go, they find me out
I wish the gusts took away my gloom
I can't help this vague feeling
I feel so good, but I'm worn out
We'll be all right, don't look so sad
Confess my sin, conceal them all
Night will come soon and swallow everything
I feel so good, but I'm worn out
We'll be all right, don't look so sad
Confess my sin, conceal them all
Night will come soon and swallow everything
I feel so good
We'll be all right
Then, I give all up
