Gracefully sneaking up on me
They just want to
tear my feathers
The golden light
of the setting sun
Let me be a hypocrite again
I will be gone before long
I know I'm wrong
No matter how far I go,
they find me out
I wish the gusts took
away my gloom
I can't help this vague feeling
I feel so good, but i"m worn out
We'll be all right,
don't look so sad
Confess my sin, conceal them all
Night will come soon
and swallow everything
Quietly hiding in the grass
Hearing the leaves rustling
The're singing
with a burning piano
It gives me cheap relief
I will be gone before long
I know I'm wrong
No matter how far I go,
they find me out
I wish the gusts took
away my gloom
I can't help this vague feeling
I feel so good, but i"m worn out
We'll be all right,
don't look so sad
Confess my sin, conceal them all
Night will come soon
and swallow everything
I feel so good
We'll be all right
Then, I give all up
